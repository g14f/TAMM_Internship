# üõÇ Passport Photo Compliance Classifier

This project is a deep learning solution for **classifying passport photos as "compliant" or "non-compliant"** using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model.  
It supports both **training from scratch** and **inference with a saved model**, with all necessary data already provided.

## üöÄ Features

- Loads and preprocesses passport photo data via CSV files (**all data is included**)
- **Image augmentation** to improve model generalization
- Handles **imbalanced classes** (95.5% non-compliant, 4.5% compliant; labels: 0/1)
- Builds a **deep learning classifier** (ResNet50, transfer learning)
- Compiled with Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and precision/recall/F1-score metrics
- **Model checkpointing:** Save/load model weights
- Can use your own models for inference or further training

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Severe class imbalance** in data (mostly non-compliant samples)
- **The saved model currently overfits:** High training accuracy, low precision/recall/F1 on validation and test sets  
- More data, rebalancing, and hyperparameter tuning are required for reliable generalization

---

## ‚è© Quick Start

- **No data preparation needed!**  
  All required image folders, CSVs, and a trained model are included in the `data/` directory.
- Specify your `data/` directory if prompted in the code.
- Use the provided model (`passport.keras`) or upload your own for inference or further training.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**  
   - Reads CSVs for image paths and labels, loads images from `train/`, `val/`, and `test/`, applies augmentation, handles imbalanced labels (`0` for non-compliant, `1` for compliant)
2. **Model Construction:**  
   - Fine-tunes a ResNet50 base
3. **Compilation:**  
   - Optimizer: Adam  
   - Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy  
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score
4. **Training & Prediction:**  
   - Trains on `train/`, validates on `val/`
   - Predicts on `test/` images (paths from `test.csv`)
   - Predictions saved to `predictions.csv`
   - Ground-truth labels for test set are in `solutions_PRIVATE.csv`
   - Accuracy, precision, and recall are computed by comparing `predictions.csv` to `solutions_PRIVATE.csv`  
     *(Results were poor due to overfitting)*

## üìù Next Steps / Improvements

- Further **hyperparameter tuning**
- Improved class balancing (e.g. oversampling, focal loss)
- Gather more compliant images
- Explore alternative architectures
